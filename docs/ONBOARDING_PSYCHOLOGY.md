# Onboarding Psychology Optimization

Cladex onboarding must reduce anxiety immediately.

## Step 1: Role Selection

**Headline:** "What type of transaction are you managing?"

**Avoid:** "Are you replacing your agent?"

Neutral framing.

## Step 2: Property Input

After user enters value, show **instant output:**

- "Estimated traditional commission range: $X – $Y"
- "Structured toolkit cost: $299 – $999"

This reframes cost immediately.

## Step 3: Summary Screen

**Headline:** "Your Structured Plan Is Ready."

Show:

- Stage roadmap
- Risk protection features
- Attorney review reminder

This reduces fear before dashboard appears.

## Emotional Progression Strategy

Onboarding must move user from:

**Uncertainty → Structure → Visibility → Control → Confidence**

Never:

**Excitement → Aggression → Anti-agent rhetoric**
