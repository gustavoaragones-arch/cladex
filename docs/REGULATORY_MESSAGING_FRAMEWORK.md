# Phase 3.75 — State-by-State Regulatory Messaging Framework

Protects long-term regulatory positioning. We do **not** build legal logic. We build messaging structure.

## Core Principle

**Never claim:** "Sell without an agent."

**Instead:** "Structured transaction management."

## State-Specific Messaging Module (Future-Proofing)

### Content Structure: `/states/[state]`

Each state page includes:

1. **Overview of closing process** — High-level, informational
2. **Whether attorney is required** — Factual, non-prescriptive
3. **Disclosure norms** — Informational only
4. **Professional review recommendation** — Encouraging, never mandatory language

### Example Tone

> In some states, attorney review is customary or required. Cladex recommends professional review prior to contract execution.

### Prohibited Language

- **Never state:** "You don't need X."
- **Always:** "Cladex does not replace licensed professionals."

## Regulatory Safety Patterns

In-app microcopy must always be:

- **Informational** — Convey facts; do not advise
- **Non-prescriptive** — Avoid "you must" / "you should"
- **Encouraging review** — Recommend professional involvement where appropriate

**Never use imperative legal language.**

### Approved Patterns

- "Cladex recommends…"
- "In some states, … is customary or required."
- "Cladex does not replace licensed professionals."
- "Consider professional review before…"

### Prohibited Patterns

- "You don't need an attorney."
- "Sell without an agent."
- "You must file…"
- "You are required to…"
